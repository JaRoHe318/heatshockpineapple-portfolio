    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I am Jason Hernandez, a biochemist who lives at the edge between wet lab work and code. 
      Most of my recent time has gone into protein assay development, high-throughput screening, and the work of making data clean enough to trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Heat Shock Pineapple</strong> is the umbrella I use for my work in science, computation, photography, and writing. 
      The name is a nod to the heat shock proteins I studied at UCSF—molecular chaperones that keep other proteins from falling apart when conditions get rough.
    </p>

    <h3>How I work</h3>
    <p>
      I like building experiments starting from the analysis. 
      First comes the question, then a definition of what good signal looks like. 
      After that I design controls, plate maps, and QC metrics that make that signal obvious. 
    </p>

    <h3>Connect</h3>
    <p>
      If you are working on assay-heavy biology and want someone who can think in both pipettes and scripts, I am happy to talk.
